## 🎯 Final 2 Steps (2 Minutes):

### Step 1: Activate Netlify DNS

In the Netlify page you have open:
- Click the green **"Continue"** button
- This activates DNS for your domain

### Step 2: Update Supabase Auth URLs

I just opened the Supabase auth configuration page. Update these:

**Site URL:**
```
https://holidaydrawnames.com
```

**Redirect URLs** (click "Add URL" button):
```
https://holidaydrawnames.com/**
https://*.holidaydrawnames.com/**
```

Click **"Save"**

## ⏰ Wait 10-20 Minutes

DNS changes need to propagate:
- Nameservers: 10-30 minutes
